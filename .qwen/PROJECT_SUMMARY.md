# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a fully automated, enhanced voice assistant system (JARVIS) that provides hands-free operation with improved features, security, and user experience using Groq AI services for transcription and responses.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Groq API (Whisper for transcription, LLaMA 3.3 for responses), ALSA for audio, SoX for silence detection, Festival/espeak for TTS
- **Architecture**: Modular design with voice-core.js containing shared functionality for audio processing, transcription, chat completion, and TTS
- **Configuration**: API keys stored in .env file, models and settings configurable via environment variables
- **Build Commands**: `./setup.sh` for installation, `./jarvis` for main execution, `./start-voice-mode.sh --menu` for mode selection
- **Security**: API keys stored in environment variables, command injection vulnerabilities fixed using execFile instead of exec
- **File Storage**: Conversation history stored in user's home directory (~/.jarvis/) with backup functionality

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Set up and configured the voice assistant system with all dependencies
- [DONE] Fixed critical API response parsing bugs in both transcription and chat completion functions
- [DONE] Enhanced TTS functionality with multiple engine fallbacks (festival, espeak-ng, espeak, say)
- [DONE] Created comprehensive error handling with user-friendly verbal feedback
- [DONE] Added advanced features: pause/resume, session statistics, auto-save, history trimming, response timeouts
- [DONE] Improved security by fixing hardcoded API key vulnerability in voice-copilot.ts
- [DONE] Consolidated codebase into unified, maintainable architecture
- [DONE] Created multiple execution modes (standard, enhanced, advanced) for different user needs
- [DONE] Enhanced conversation persistence with auto-backup functionality
- [DONE] Performed comprehensive audit using gemini-cli for additional security and performance improvements

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete comprehensive low-level audit of all features, functions, and code
- [DONE] Fix all identified security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and architectural problems
- [DONE] Optimize error handling and improve user experience
- [DONE] Consolidate multiple jarvis files into unified, maintainable architecture
- [DONE] Implement advanced features like pause/resume, statistics, auto-save
- [TODO] Document all configuration options and usage patterns for maintainers
- [TODO] Create comprehensive testing suite to validate all functionality
- [TODO] Implement cross-platform audio library support for broader compatibility
