Note: Authentication not enforced yet - health endpoint accessible without API key","Next.js web interface built successfully and running on port 3000. Fixed TypeScript error in VoiceRecorder component. Interface loads correctly with all features.","Remote control interface running on localhost:8000. app.local.js configuration file exists with password hash, server URL, and API key.","Tailscale running and connected. Current device IP: 100.82.176.27. API server accessible via Tailscale network. Other devices (iPhone, linux) visible but offline.","API endpoints tested - ISSUE FOUND: All Groq models are blocked at project level. User needs to visit https://console.groq.com/settings/project/limits to enable models. Chat, execute, and files endpoints exist but cannot test without enabled models. Code execution and file operations should work independently of AI models.","CLI commands tested - execute command works perfectly. AI-dependent commands (generate, chat, explain) fail due to Groq model permissions. Non-AI functionality fully operational.","GitHub Pages deployment verified - Marketing site and remote control interface both deployed and accessible at https://senpai-sama7.github.io/jarvis/"],"modified_files":["components/VoiceRecorder.tsx","components/VoiceRecorder.tsx","src/core/ai/groq-client.ts","src/core/config/index.ts","src/interfaces/api/routes/chat.ts",".env"],"id":"1761815957350"}
